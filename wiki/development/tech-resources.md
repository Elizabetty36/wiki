We understand that the tech/dev side is fundamental to developing web3 projects and taking them to the next level. Below are a collection of some of the most commonly referenced and most sought after technichal resources to help you get started.


## Theoretical Documentation 

* [Wallet Selector repo for integrating NEAR Wallets into your dApp](https://github.com/near/wallet-selector)
    * [Guide for Wallet Selector](https://github.com/near/wallet-selector/blob/dev/packages/core/docs/guides/custom-wallets.md)
* [NEAR SDK resources for smart contract development](https://docs.near.org/sdk/welcome)
* [Technical Documentation Directory](https://docs.near.org/)
* [Near spec website](http://nomicon.io/)

## How to Run Nodes

* Local Node using near: If you want to run a node locally for testing (and don't have the space to download all the data) [https://github.com/near/nearup](https://github.com/near/nearup)
* Run RPC node using near: https://near-nodes.io/rpc/run-rpc-node-without-nearup (replace with validator node https://near-nodes.io/validator/validator-bootcamp for validator, custody partners or archival node for exchanges https://near-nodes.io/archival/run-archival-node-without-nearup)
