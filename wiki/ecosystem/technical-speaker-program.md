# NEAR Technical Speaker Program 


### OVERVIEW 

In the Web3 ecosystem, there is an endless stream of events around the globe and the number of events is increasing every year. The demand for NEAR-knowledgeable speakers at these events is high, and our current model of sending core NEARians is proving to be unscalable. Thankfully, the NEAR ecosystem is full of knowledgeable, enthusiastic community members who are well-versed on the nuances of the NEAR ecosystem. 

### APPLICATION

#### OBJECTIVES



1. The NF will amass a legion of technical (and eventually, non-technical) volunteer speakers to represent NEAR across the globe at events, conferences, meetups, and workshops. 
2. To empower and enable these individuals, the NEAR Foundation Technical Speaker Program will offer guidelines, public speaking training, and a streamlined set of standards, principles, and content outlines for each speaker to ensure consistent quality and messaging. 
3. Later phases will include decentralized content curation/management, decentralized speaker selection processes, and collaborative coaching and mentorship models.


##### DESIRED OUTCOMES



* Engaged and active community of tech evangelists to represent NEAR across the globe
* Regularly maintained and easily accessible set of standardized guidelines and “playbooks” for training, content, etc. 
* NEAR community members have a vested sense of ownership in the success of the NEAR ecosystem


### WHY YOU SHOULD GET INVOLVED



* Be recognized as a NEAR Technical Speaker across NEAR the ecosystem
* Represent NEAR in your local community and region

| Web3 Experts: Web3 community leaders and top NEAR contributors |  <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap',fontSize: 'smaller',padding: '8px', borderRadius: '15px', backgroundColor: 'rgb(255, 229, 160)'}}>In Progress</span>  | Q2 2023 | The second phase of the rollout will look to equip prominent Web3 leaders as well as top contributors within the NEAR ecosystem with the resources and talking points necessary for them to speak on behalf of NEAR across the Web3 ecosystem. |
| Local Experts: Local community leaders based on geo |  <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap',fontSize: 'smaller',padding: '8px', borderRadius: '15px', backgroundColor: 'rgb(230, 230, 230)'}}>Not started</span>  | Q3 2023 | The third phase of the rollout will allow the NF to work with regional/local leaders to strategize and help establish topics and speaker notes that are most relevant and impactful within their local regional communities. This phase will be closely monitored and managed by the regional hubs, with high-level guidelines and standards provided by the NF. |
