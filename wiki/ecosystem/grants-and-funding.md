Overall, the standard application review time is 4-6 weeks. The table above features grant amount categories that you might consider when determining how much to apply for. For grants &lt;$100K we can typically move more quickly in the approval process, especially for projects under $50K. Grants &lt;$100K account for the majority of our accepted applicants. As the grant amount increases, notably past $250K, you may want to consider our Direct Investments, Ecosystem Funding, or Backer Network instead.


We encourage projects applying for the first time to submit an application for a pilot of their project. Typically pilot projects have been funded on average at ~$60K for 3-6 months of dev work.

## Education Grants

The [NEAR Education Team](http://near.university/grants) offers grants to projects sharing their mission of educating and enabling 1 million individuals (developers, entrepreneurs and educators) by 2023. You may qualify for an education grant if you are developing:



* Software projects - For devs of open source educational components, whether standalone or part of a team
* Services - For educators to create tutorials, videos, workshops, or write docs for builders.
* Other Projects - For local, national and global meetups and trainings

Visit [near.university/grants](http://near.university/grants) to apply and learn more.


## Grant Pools

Through Grant Pools, NEAR Foundation enables tier 1 projects to stand up their own separately run grants programs.  

Eligible mature projects are built on the NEAR platform with proven traction and value-add to the NEAR ecosystem. The Grant Pool therefore, amplifies the project’s existing momentum by investing in a mini ecosystem within the broader NEAR ecosystem. All projects seeking their own Grant Pool are held to 3 core responsibilities:  Raise awareness of NEAR, support projects building on NEAR, and provide a clear and safe path to decentralization.


## Direct Investments

In some cases, NEAR Foundation will support ecosystem projects with equity or token investments. NEAR Foundation looks to back extremely ambitious, tier 1 founders and projects that bring a strong strategic value and adoption to the NEAR ecosystem. NEAR Foundation does not look to lead rounds but instead co-invest with the NEAR backer network. If you are a founder interested in an investment from NEAR Foundation or the NEAR backer network, please email us at funding@near.foundation or [complete the following form](https://nearprotocol1001.typeform.com/nearvcnetwork?typeform-source=www.google.com).

## DAO Investments

NEAR Foundation is keen to participate in growing DAO ecosystems on NEAR and having NEAR Protocol and Astro DAO play a meaningful role within the overall DAO landscape. We look to invest and participate in both NEAR-native DAOs as well as non-native DAOs that can provide a strategic value for growing NEAR’s reach within the overall DAO landscape.
