# Decentralization, Open-Source, and the Blockchain Operating System


Decentralization and Open-Source development are cornerstones of a free and open web. They promote transparency and collaboration and reduce the power of people who seek to control the web for their own profit or power. Decentralized, open-source projects have been essential in building the Internet by encouraging autonomy, innovation, and community-driven development. Theyâ€™re also at the core of the Blockchain Operating System (BOS).

The World Wide Web has become more and more centralized over time as our online experiences and identities have become increasingly controlled by a small number of large corporations. Unfortunately, this centralization has increased the power and profits of those very few people and organizations. 

As more people understand this problem, there are growing calls and efforts to return to the decentralized principles that built the Internet in the first place, with a particular focus on taking back control of our information and ownership of our digital lives. The BOS is one of these projects.


## Decentralization 

_The dispersion or distribution of power_

At its core, decentralization aims to create a more democratic, participatory, and efficient system by giving individuals and communities greater control over their lives. It encourages the participation of everyone in decision-making processes. While this benefits all of us, it can be particularly helpful for marginalized and underrepresented groups who have had less power in the past.

Decentralized internet systems ensure network resilience by distributing their resources across multiple nodes, ensuring no single point of failure exists. This allows information to flow freely, making it more difficult for governments or organizations to dominate and control. Decentralization also helps counter the power of tech giants, promoting a more equitable distribution of wealth and influence across the internet. 


## Open Source

_Having the source code freely available for inspection, modification, and redistribution._

Open Source contributes to the democratization of technology as it fosters collaboration and innovation among individuals worldwide. As source code is accessible to the public, it allows people to understand how systems work, identify vulnerabilities, and suggest improvements to security and reliability over time. This transparency helps build trust as the Open Source development process lets people see how decisions are made and verify software integrity. 

Having this information freely accessible empowers individuals, regardless of financial resources, to access powerful knowledge and tools they might not otherwise have the privilege of utilizing. This provides the opportunity for a more diverse community of contributors and ultimately promotes a more open and inclusive world.


## The BOS: a Decentralized, Open Source Platform for All

The Blockchain Operating System is built from the ground up as a decentralized operating system powered by Open Source software. Blockchain technology ensures that decentralization is achieved as every node in the network can validate the authenticity of the code and stored data. 

While this decentralization is true of all blockchains, the BOS takes this further by making all aspects of the applications that run on it both decentralized and Open Source. On the BOS, all code is stored on the NEAR Blockchain and can be reviewed by others. Any node that tampers with the code or data is flagged and rejected. 

The BOS allows developers of all backgrounds to start building quickly with composable apps and the ability to code in JavaScript. Its focus on simplicity, UX, and discoverability benefits developers, enterprises, and users alike and helps bring us much closer to a decentralized digital future where users own and control their data.
